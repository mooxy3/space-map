I want to make a website, the website is a space map website, the space map is for a captain who drives in space ships, and navigates to the planet where they want to go.

home page:
The body of the page is a photo of a space station, center of the page: READY TO FLY, in a fitable size. At the top of the page will be a navbar. The right of the navbar is a login button (you can only enter the map after a login). You also need to make a register page, users need to fill email, password, and your ship name to register, no need to send verification mail.
After logging in, the navbar will appearwith 2 more things, that is: credits and map, credits u cant click on; you will have 200 credits automatically after registering, and the map. I will tell u soon, after logingin the login button will change to the logout button

map page: 
navbar stay the same as I told, the map page is a 3D space map in the solar system, where use and look around in 3D, but you need to add some more things in the solar system, every planet and moon needs to have 2 - 4 more space stations, you can decide yourself how many, every space station haves onw name.
All planets and moons are 3D models.
The space station will move with the planet's orbit, and every planet will move with the sun’s orbit; it really need moves in the map.
The user can click on every space station and planet, and info will appears rightside of the screen, like a next:
name:
location:
What to do in this place:
short history

navigate

When you click on the navigate button, a line will appear from your ship to the destination. Important! The line can absolutely not going thrue planets, ifyou need to go from A to  B, but a planet is between, or something like this, then the navigator will go to another place first and then go to the destination!

map control: 
scroll:l zoom in and zoom out
Left mouse button: rotate the camera from the center point
right mouse button: move vertically

syle
The whole website is blue/dark transparency Ci-Fi style, and makes buttons andthe user interface fancy and smooth. Space station and planets are also a bit transparent blue.

If you make with HTML, CSS, JS, and other files what you need, create these files in the folder: deepdive-3.  HTML, CSS, and JS parts put them in a part from together.
